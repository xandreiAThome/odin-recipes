      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (13 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 (13 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>12 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to
          a boil without stirring to avoid the mixture crystallizing. Continue
          to boil, swirling the pan occasionally, until sugar syrup begins to
          brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low and watch the
          color. Once the caramel is a deep brown, immediately pour it into a
          flan mold. Carefully tilt the mold to make sure the whole bottom
          surface is covered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine evaporated milk, condensed milk, egg yolks, and vanilla
          extract in a large bowl. Stir lightly to prevent bubbles or foam from
          forming. Strain batter slowly into the caramel-lined flan mold. Cover
          with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a baking dish large enough to hold the flan mold on the oven
          rack. Set the covered flan in the baking dish and add enough hot water
          to come halfway up the side of the mold.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 1 hour. Carefully remove
          the flan mold from the oven. Let cool, about 30 minutes. Run a paring
          knife around the edges of the flan. Cover the mold with a rimmed
          platter and carefully flip it over to release the flan from the mold
          for serving.
