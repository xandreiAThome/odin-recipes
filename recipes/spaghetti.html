      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p class="description">
        Filipino Spaghetti is the Pinoy version of Spaghetti with meat sauce.
        This version has a sweet tomato based sauce with lots of meat
        ingredients such as ground pork, luncheon meat, and hotdogs. It is often
        served during kid’s birthday parties along with some yummy fried chicken

      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 pounds spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (26.5 ounce) can spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) jar banana ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 pound hot dogs, sliced diagonally</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil
          over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and
          return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally,
          until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite,
          about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the
          garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and
          turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beef and pork; season
          with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the meat has browned. Pour
          in the spaghetti sauce, banana ketchup, sugar, and water. Simmer until
          the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in hot dog slices and
          continue to cook until hot dogs are heated through. Serve over
          spaghetti with Cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.
